# Jethro's Braindump

This braindump is generated via
[ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) and uses an adapted
version of the [er](https://github.com/lingxz/er) theme.

The org files used to generate the markdown files are also hosted here
for posterity. They can be found in [the org folder](https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/tree/master/org).
