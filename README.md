# Jethro's Braindump

This braindump is generated via
[ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) and uses an adapted
version of the [er](https://github.com/lingxz/er) theme.

I used to host the org files here and the same setup can still be
found [here](https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump-archive/).
