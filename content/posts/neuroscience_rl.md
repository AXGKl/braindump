[Reinforcement Learning ⭐]({{< relref "reinforcement_learning" >}}) is similar to how humans learn:

- Learning by trial-and-error
- Reward is often delayed

TD errors ([Temporal Difference Learning]({{< relref "td_learning" >}})) model the activity of
dopamine neurons ([Schultz, Dayan, and Montague, n.d.](#org909a496))
