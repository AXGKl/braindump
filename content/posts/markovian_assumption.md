**Key idea**: the past and future data are independent, conditioned on the
present.

The Markovian assumption can be violated in many ways:

1.  Unmodelled dynamics in the environment
2.  Inaccuracies in probabilistic models
3.  Approximation errors when using approximate representations of
    belief functions
