Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal spike
trains in [Spiking Neural Networks]({{< relref "spiking_neural_networks" >}}). Perhaps we can learn some low-level spike
representation, and relate this somehow to [Information Bottleneck in Deep Neural
Networks]({{< relref "information_bottleneck_dnn" >}}).
