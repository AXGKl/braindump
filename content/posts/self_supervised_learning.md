## Self-supervised Learning vs Other Learning Paradigms {#self-supervised-learning-vs-other-learning-paradigms}

In self-supervised learning, the machine predicts any part of its input for any observed part. For example, it may predict future frames in videos. This results in a lot of feedback.

In [Reinforcement Learning ‚≠ê]({{< relref "reinforcement_learning" >}}), the machine predicts a scalar reward given weak feedback once in a while. Since there is very little feedback, it seems impossible to learn any complex representations in a short amount of time.
