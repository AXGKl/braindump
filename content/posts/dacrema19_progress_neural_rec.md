The authors analyzed various recent publications on recommendation
systems techniques, and found that these have:

1.  Weak baselines
2.  Establish weak methods as baselines
3.  Are outperformed by simple, sometimes non-neural approaches

The simple approaches that work well include ItemKNN, a
collaborative-filtering approach that uses k-nearest neighbours and
item-item similarities:

\begin{equation}
s\_{ij} = \frac{r_i \dot r_j}{\lvert r_i \rvert \lvert r_j \rvert + h}
\end{equation}

To alleviate these issues:

1.  Use appropriate evaluation methods
2.  Evaluate on appropriate datasets (size is important)
3.  Release reproducible code
