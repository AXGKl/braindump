## Landing a Rover {#landing-a-rover}

Landing on Mars is challenging because there's is too much
atmosphere to be ignored, but too little to cushion the landing.
Hence, all Mars rovers will have a three phrases: Entry, Descent and
Landing (abbrieviated EDL). ([Lakdawalla, n.d.](#orge38a362))

## How the Curiosity Rover worked {#how-the-curiosity-rover-worked}

- Lots of redundancy. A-side and B-side electronics.
- The battery was a [MMRTG battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission%5Fradioisotope%5Fthermoelectric%5Fgenerator). Curiosity used plutonium-238 as the
  nuclear fuel, and an array of thermocouples reliably converted the
  released heat into electricity with no moving parts.

Things to account for:

- Operating temperatures of each component. Scientists maintained a
  heating table, and also had schedules to ensure that the various
  parts were heated to operating temperature before functioning.
- Have a system collecting heat output from energy
