Non-parametric filters do not make strong assumptions on the posterior
density, making them well suited for complex, multi-modal beliefs. The
representational power comes at the cost of computational complexity.

Some non-parametric techniques allow adaptivity. For example, particle
filters can adapt the number of particles based on the available
compute resources.
