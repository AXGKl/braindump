Humans are able to perform dexterous manipulation of everyday, unseen objects
with their limbs. Yet, it remains a challenge for robots to perform grasping and
manipulation of objects.

## Challenges {#challenges}

1.  The robot needs to adapt to changes in the environment.
2.  The robot is susceptible to noise and errors in the environment, in control,
    in perception, and perturbations to the robot itself.

## Grasping Approaches {#grasping-approaches}

Dexterous manipulation
: manipulation with fingers

Enveloping grasps
: formed by wrapping both fingers and palm around object

    Enveloping grasps have superior stability. Grasping Simulators such as
    (GraspIt!) have been made available for theoretical research.
