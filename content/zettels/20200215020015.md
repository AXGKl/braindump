Example-based learning for abstract material

Use the [Three-pass Technique]({{< relref "20200215020843" >}}) for reading papers

Use [Spaced Repetition]({{< relref "spaced_repetition" >}}), both for "memorizing" disconnected information,
    as well as "memorizing" connections between information nodes.

Use the [Feynman Technique]({{< relref "20200215021546" >}})

Reading techniques from [How To Read A Book]({{< relref "20200215021714" >}})
    -   **Inspectional Reading:** to decide whether a book is worth reading
        (about 15 min)
    -   **Analytical Reading:** ask yourself questions (i.e. active
        reading)
