Multi-modal translation is a sub-challenge in [multi-modal machine
learning]({{< relref "20200219115844_multimodal_machine_learning" >}}), involving the translation of one modality to another. Some
applications of multi-modal translation involve speech synthesis,
video description, and cross-modal retrieval. Image and video
captioning is a particularly popular problem, with large multi-modal
datasets available.

Multi-modal translation can be categorized into _example-based_, and
_generative_ approaches <a id="fe1ca450aa5e404428b89a0e174b2e99" href="#baltrusaitis17:_multim_machin_learn">(Baltru\vsaitis et al., 2017)</a>.

## Example-based {#example-based}

Example-based models use a dictionary to translate between modalities.
These algorithms are restricted by their training data.

**Retrieval-based models** rely on finding the closest sample in the
dictionary, and using that as the translated result. The similarity
metric can be computed in some semantic space. Retrieval approaches in
semantic space tend to perform better than in the unimodal space, as
this space is optimized for retrieval. They also allow for
bi-directional translation. However, these approaches require either
manual construction or learning of this semantic space, which requires
large datasets.

**Combination-based** models extend retrieval-based models, by combining
multiple examples from the dictionary to construct a better
translation. These approaches are motivated by the fact that sentence
descriptions of images often share a common and simple structure that
could be exploited. These rules are often hand-crafted, or based on
heuristics.

Example-based approaches are often large and have slow inference
speeds, because of the large dictionaries.


## Generative {#generative}

The generative approach constructs a model that is able to produce a
translation. This requires the ability to both understand the source
modlity, as well as generate the target squence or signal. Thes
methods are also difficult to evaluate.

**Grammar-based models** rely on a pre-defined grammar for generating a
particular modality. They detect high level concepts from the source
modality, such as objects in images. These detections are incorporated
together with a generation procedure, such as a rule-based sentence
generation. These models are more likely to generate syntactically and
logically correct target instances, due to the predefined templates
and restrictive grammars, but limits the creative output of the model.

**Encoder-decoder models** use end-to-end trained neural networks, first
encoding the source modality into a vectorial representation, and
later decoding it to generate the target modality.

**Continuous generation models** are intended for sequence translation,
 and produce outputs at every timestep in an online manner. These
 models are often seen in text-to-speech, speech-to-text, or
 video-to-text. Encoder-decoder approaches are common used. Continuous
 generation models have to tackle the additional difficulty of
 temporal consistency between modalities.
