Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal
spike trains in [§spiking\_neural\_networks]({{< relref "spiking_neural_networks" >}}). Perhaps we can learn some
low-level spike representation, and relate this somehow to the
[§information\_bottleneck\_dnn]({{< relref "information_bottleneck_dnn" >}}) theory.
