## Investor vs Speculator {#investor-vs-speculator}

The investor must recognize the existence of a _speculative factor_ in their common-stock holdings, and keep this components within minor limits.

The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.

1.  Always thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of the underlying businesses, before buying its stock.
2.  Deliberate protect yourself against serious losses
3.  aspire to "adequate", not extraordinary performance
