## Motivations {#motivations}

-   There's a ton of books covering the art of writing, and very little
    on note-taking.
-   These books don't cover the connections between note-taking and
    writing well.

The mind is extremely reliant of external scaffolding:

> Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not make contemporary
> physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
> possible -- Neil Levy (Neuroethics and the Extended Mind)

Hence, use the [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}) method. To get around this idea of
note-taking, it is important to understand that:

1.  Note sequences are meant for developing ideas, not storing them
2.  Links and indices  are helpful, but not central features
3.  The workflow is streamlined to writing

In [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}), the most time-consuming portion is determining _the
order_ for the notes in which to write about.
