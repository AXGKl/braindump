## Motivations {#motivations}

-   There's a ton of books covering the art of writing, and very little
    on note-taking.
-   These books don't cover the connections between note-taking and
    writing well.

> Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking
> process. -- [Richard Feynman]({{< relref "20200213173516" >}})

The mind is extremely reliant of external scaffolding:

> Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not make contemporary
> physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
> possible -- Neil Levy (Neuroethics and the Extended Mind)

Hence, use the [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}) method. To get around this idea of
note-taking, it is important to understand that:

1.  Note sequences are meant for developing ideas, not storing them
2.  Links and indices are helpful, but not central features
3.  The workflow is streamlined to writing

In [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}), the most time-consuming portion is determining _the
order_ for the notes in which to write about.


## Concrete Changes {#concrete-changes}

1.  Instead of highlighting passages, manually create notes of the
    ideas you get as you read. These notes should be relevant to the
    contexts important to you, not just related to the book you read.

2.  Always reference the source. Cite, or indicate the page number.
3.  When copying notes over, try to make the ideas standalone.
4.  When filing notes, think instead about: _in which context will I
    want to stumble on it again?_ Use tags for this.
