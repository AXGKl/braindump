#+TITLE: Zeigarnik Effect

Simply put, the Zeigarnik effect is the observation that /interrupted
tasks are better remembered than completed ones/. This has
ramifications for [[file:productivity.org][productivity]].

An example of applying the Zeigarnik Effect would be to stop coding
halfway while having a good streak, and come back another day.
