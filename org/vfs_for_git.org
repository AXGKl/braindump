VFS for [[file:git.org][Git]] is a virtualized filesystem used to bypass assumptions
about repository size, allowing Git repositories to scale up to large
repositories.

With GVFS, an initial clone downloads a set of pack-files containing
only commits and trees. These objects are sufficient for generating a
view of the working directory, and examining the commit history with
git log.

GVFS allows dynamically downloading objects as needed.
