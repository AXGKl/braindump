#+TITLE: Multi-modal Alignment

Multi-modal alignment is a sub-challenge in [[file:20200219115844_multimodal_machine_learning.org][Multi-modal Machine
Learning]], involving the finding of relationships and correspondences
between sub-components of instances from two-or-more modalities. For
example, we want to find areas of the image corresponding to the
caption's words or phrases.

In explicit multi-modal alignment, the objective of aligning
sub-components in modalities is of interest. In implicit multi-modal
alignment, this is typically an intermediate step for another task.

* Explicit Alignmnt

Explicit alignment algorithms can be further split into unsupervised
and weakly-supervised algorithms.

The unsupervised approaches do not require or use any direct alignment
labels. [[file:20200219163624_dynamic_time_warping.org][Dynamic Time Warping]] is a dynamic progamming approach to align
multi-view time series.

* Implicit Alignment

Implicit alignment allows for better performance in downstream tasks.
Both graphical models and neural network approaches are used here.
Examples of tasks where implicit alignment helps include machine
translation.
