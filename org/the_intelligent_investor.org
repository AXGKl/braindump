* Investor vs Speculator

The investor must recognize the existence of a /speculative factor/ in their common-stock holdings, and keep this components within minor limits.

The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.

1. Always thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of the underlying businesses, before buying its stock.
2. Deliberate protect yourself against serious losses
3. aspire to "adequate", not extraordinary performance
