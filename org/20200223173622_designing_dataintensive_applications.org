* Preface

- Data abstractions are well-built (databases, etc.) but the
  boundaries are blurring
- Design decisions are highly centered around data requirements (both
  functional and non-functional requirements)
- How to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications

* Data Models

- Prevalence of SQL
- NoSQL has benefits of being schemaless (lower impedence mismatch)
  and storage locality, when fetching whole documents
  - joins are poorly implemented, can't access nested item in document efficiently
- Graph DBs implement many-to-many relationships well, also somewhat schemaless
