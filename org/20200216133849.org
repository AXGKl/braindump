definitions by various people:

- [[file:20200216133924.org][Yann LeCun]] :: DL is constructing networks of parameterized
  functional modules & training them from examples using
  gradient-based optimization ([[https://www.facebook.com/722677142/posts/10156463919392143/][Source]])
  - Definition is orthogonal to the learning paradigm: paradigm,
