#+TITLE: Canonical Correlation Analysis

Canonical Correlation Analysis computes a linear projection which
maximizes the correlation between two random variables andn enforces
orthogonality in the new space. This is commonly used in [[file:multimodal_representation.org][multi-modal
representation]] learning, where the random variables are modalities.

Extensions of CCA include Kernel CCA, which uses a non-linear
projection, and Deep CCA, which addresses the scalability issues of KCCA.
