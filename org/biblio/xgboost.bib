  abstract =     {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used
                  machine learning method. In this paper, we describe
                  a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called
                  XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to
                  achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine
                  learning challenges. We propose a novel
                  sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and
                  weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree
                  learning. More importantly, we provide insights on
                  cache access patterns, data compression and sharding
                  to build a scalable tree boosting system. By
                  combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond
                  billions of examples using far fewer resources than
                  existing systems.},
