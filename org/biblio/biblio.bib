  abstract = {Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel
texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which
something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as
multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. Baltru\vsaitis, Tadas, Ahuja, C., & Morency, L., Multimodal machine learning: a survey and taxonomy, CoRR, (),  (2017). In order for Artificial
Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to
be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine
learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from
multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing
importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific
multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal
machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond
the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader
challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely:
representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new
taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field
and identify directions for future research.},
