#+title: Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a dynamic programming approach used to
align multi-view time series. The similarity between two sequences are
measured, and used to find an optimal match between them via
time-warping (inserting frames).

This approach requires timesteps in the two sequences to be
comparable, and requires a similarity measure between sequences.
Because DTW requires a pre-defined similarity measure, it has been
extended to [[file:canonical_correlation_analysis.org][Canonical Correlation Analysis]] which does this computation
in a coordinated space for [[file:multimodal_machine_learning.org][Multi-modal Machine Learning]]. This allows
for both aligning and mapping between different modalities jointly in
ean unsupervised manner.
