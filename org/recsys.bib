  abstract =     {Deep learning techniques have become the method of
                  choice for researchers working on algorithmic
                  aspects of recommender systems. With the strongly
                  increased interest in machine learning in general,
                  it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track
                  of what represents the state-of-the-art at the
                  moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the
                  same time, several recent publications point out
                  problems in today's research practice in applied
                  machine learning, e.g., in terms of the
                  reproducibility of the results or the choice of the
                  baselines when proposing new models. In this work,
                  we report the results of a systematic analysis of
                  algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation
                  tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms
                  that were presented at top-level research
                  conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could
                  be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these
                  methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can
                  often be outperformed with comparably simple
                  heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor
                  or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly
                  outperformed the baselines but did not consistently
                  outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking
                  method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of
                  potential problems in today's machine learning
                  scholarship and calls for improved scientific
                  practices in this area. Source code of our
                  experiments and full results are available at:
