* Problem Formulation
Machine learning takes a given training dataset $D$ and learns a model
$\hat{\theta}$. The learner can take various formrs, including version
space learners, Bayesian learners, deep neural networks, or cognitive
models.

In contrast, in machine teaching the target model $\theta^*$ is given,
and the teacher finds a teaching set $D$ -- not necessarily i.i.d. -
such that a machine learner trained on $D$ will approximately learn
$\theta^*$.

In machine teaching, we wish to solve the following optimization
problem:

\begin{align}
  \begin{matrix}
    \textrm{min}_{D, \hat{\theta}} & \textrm{TeachingRisk}(\hat{\theta}) +
                             \eta \textrm{TeachingCost}(D) \\
  \textrm{s.t.} & \hat{\theta} = \textrm{MachineLearning}(D).
  \end{matrix}
\end{align}

Where $\textrm{TeachingRisk(\hat{\theta})}$ is a generic function for
how unsatisfied the teacher is. The target model $\theta^*$ is folded
into the teaching risk function. The teaching cost function is also
generalized beyond the number of teaching items. For example,
different teaching items may have different cognitive burdens for a
human student to absorb. cite:zhu18_overv_machin_teach

There are other formulations of machine teaching that place different
constraints on the teaching. For example, one may want to minimize the
teaching cost, while constraining the teaching risk, or instead choose
to optimize the teaching risk given constraints on the teaching cost.

** Why bother if $\theta^*$ is known?

There are applications where the teacher needs to convey the target
model $\theta^*$ to a learner via training data. For example:

- In education problems, the teacher may know $\theta^*$ but is unable
  to telepathize the model to the students. If the teacher possesses a
  good cognitive model on how students learn from samples, they can
  use machine teaching to optimize the choice of learning examples.
- In training-set poisoning, an attacker manipulates the behaviour of
  a machine learning system by maliciously modifying the training
  data. An attacker knowing the algorithm may send specially designed
  training examples to manipulate the learning algorithm.




* Faster Teaching Via POMDP Teaching cite:Rafferty_2015

The authors formulate teaching as a POMDP, and use a
decision-theoretic approach to planning teaching. Assuming knowledge
about the student's learning model, the teacher is able to find
optimal teaching actions.

A POMDP is specified as a tuple:

\begin{equation}
  \langle S, A, Z, p(s'|s, a), p(z|s,a), r(s,a), \gamma \rangle
\end{equation}

- S :: set of states
- A :: set of actions
- Z :: set of observations
- $p(s' | s, a)$ :: transition model
- $p(z|s, a)$ ::  Probability of observing z
- $r(s,a)$ :: Reward/cost model
- $\gamma$ :: Discount factor

POMDP planning seeks to choose actions that minimize
$\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t)$.

The learner model specifies the space $S$ of possible knowledge
states, and transition model $p(s'|s ,a)$ for how knowledge changes.

Simple learner models for concept learning can be specified. For
example, in the memoryless model, if an action is consistent with the
current concept, then the state stays the same. Else, the learner
transitions to a state that is consistent with the action, with
probability proportional to the prior probability of the concept:

\begin{equation}
  p(s_{t+1} = c_i | s_t = c_j , a_t) = \begin{cases}
    p_0(c_i) & \textrm{ if $c_i$ is consistent with $a_t$} \\
    0 & \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Experiments showed that POMDP planning leads to faster teaching.

** Limitations
1. POMDP relies on having models of learning. The models that we
   currently have do not fully model human learning. Human learners
   can also learn better if they are aware they are being taught. The
   models are not accurate enough to know when to decide to terminate
   teaching. *Are we able to learn to teach without explicitly
   assuming a student model?*

2. Beyond time to teach, it is difficult to incorporate other factors
   such as motivation. The learners may have their own reward
   function, and a joint optimization of the student and teacher
   rewards is computationally more difficult.

3. POMDP can be computationally intractable, requiring the use of
   techniques such as MCTS and forward search, sampling only possible
   actions taken.

   1. Suppose a task is modelled with a discrete state space. A task
      with 1000 states will result in a belief state of 1000
      dimensions. To overcome this "curse of dimensionality",
      point-based POMDP algorithms like HSVI2 and SARSOP use
      probabilistic sampling.

   2. One can also factor out the fully observable state components to
      reduce the dimensionality of the belief space into $S = X \times
      Y$, where $X$ is the space of all possible values fully
      observable variables, and $Y$ is the space of partially
      observable variables.  cite:Du2010APA Since state variable $x$
      is fully observable, we only need to maintain belief $b_Y$ for
      the state variables in $Y$.

* Bayesian Teaching
Bayesian teaching aims to induce a target model in the learner by
presenting teaching sets of data. This involves two sides of
inference:

1. Teacher's inference: over the space of possible teaching sets
2. Learner's inference: over the space of possible target models

** Bayesian Teaching as Model Explanation
The intuition is that subsets of training data that lead a model to
the same (or approximately similar) inference as the model trained on
all the data should be useful for understanding the fitted model.
cite:ravi_bayesian_teaching_mnist

Below is an example of using Bayesian teaching, limited to a teaching
set of dimension 2, to understand an MNIST model.

One can inspect the best and worst teaching sets to understand what
the model finds to be the best and worst representations for a
particular number.

Hence, Bayesian teaching is also useful in telling us which examples
are most valuable: better suited to induce the desired target model.
