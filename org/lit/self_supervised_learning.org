In self-supervised learning, the machine predicts any part of its input for any observed part. For example, it may predict future frames in videos. This results in a lot of feedback.

In [[file:../reinforcement_learning.org][Reinforcement Learning ‚≠ê]], the machine predicts a scalar reward given weak feedback once in a while. Since there is very little feedback, it seems impossible to learn any complex representations in a short amount of time.
