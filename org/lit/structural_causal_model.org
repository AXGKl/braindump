#+title: Structural Causal Model

A structural causal model satisfies the following conditions:

1. It is a directed acyclic graph $G$ with vertices $X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}$
2. Vertices are observables, and arrows represent direct causation
3. Each observable $X_{i}$ is a density, with independent unexplained random
   variables $U_{i}, \dots, U_{n}$.

The structural causal model satisfies the [[file:reichenbach_s_principle.org][Reichenbach's principle]].
