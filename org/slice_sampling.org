#+title: Slice Sampling

Slice sampling has similarities to [[file:gibbs_sampling.org][Gibbs sampling]], [[file:rejection_sampling.org][Rejection Sampling]]
and the [[file:metropolis_hastings.org][Metropolis-Hastings method]]. The advantage over simple
[[file:metropolis_hastings.org][Metropolis-Hastings]] methods is that it is robust to the choice of
parameters. Like rejection sampling, it asymptotically draws samples
from volume under the curve $p^\star(x)$.

A good treatment of slice sampling can be found in Mackay's Book
[[http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf][Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms]].
