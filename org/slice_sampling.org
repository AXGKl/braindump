#+TITLE: Slice Sampling

Slice sampling has similarities to [[file:gibbs_sampling.org][§gibbs_sampling]],
[[file:rejection_sampling.org][§rejection_sampling]] and the [[file:metropolis_hastings.org][§metropolis_hastings]] method. The advantage
over simple [[file:metropolis_hastings.org][§metropolis_hastings]] methods is that  it is robust to the
choice of parameters. Like rejection sampling, it asymptotically draws
samples from volume under the curve $p^\star(x)$.

A good treatment of slice sampling can be found in Mackay's Book
[[http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf][Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms]].
