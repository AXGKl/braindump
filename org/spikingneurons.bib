  abstract =     {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are distributed
                  trainable systems whose computing elements, or
                  neurons, are characterized by internal analog
                  dynamics and by digital and sparse synaptic
                  communications. The sparsity of the synaptic spiking
                  inputs and the corresponding event-driven nature of
                  neural processing can be leveraged by hardware
                  implementations that have demonstrated significant
                  energy reductions as compared to conventional
                  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Most existing
                  training algorithms for SNNs have been designed
                  either for biological plausibility or through
                  conversion from pre-trained ANNs via rate encoding.
                  This paper aims at providing an introduction to SNNs
                  by focusing on a probabilistic signal processing
                  methodology that enables the direct derivation of
                  learning rules leveraging the unique time encoding
                  capabilities of SNNs. To this end, the paper adopts
                  discrete-time probabilistic models for networked
                  spiking neurons, and it derives supervised and
                  unsupervised learning rules from first principles by
                  using variational inference. Examples and open
                  research problems are also provided.},
