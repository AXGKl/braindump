  abstract =     {The current processes for building machine learning
                  systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of
                  machine learning. This significantly limits the
                  number of machine learning systems that can be
                  created and has led to a mismatch between the demand
                  for machine learning systems and the ability for
                  organizations to build them. We believe that in
                  order to meet this growing demand for machine
                  learning systems we must significantly increase the
                  number of individuals that can teach machines. We
                  postulate that we can achieve this goal by making
                  the process of teaching machines easy, fast and
                  above all, universally accessible. While machine
                  learning focuses on creating new algorithms and
                  improving the accuracy of "learners", the machine
                  teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the
                  "teachers". Machine teaching as a discipline is a
                  paradigm shift that follows and extends principles
                  of software engineering and programming languages.
                  We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the
                  teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial
                  components such as techniques and design principles
                  of interaction and visualization. In this paper, we
                  present our position regarding the discipline of
                  machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine
                  teaching principles. We also describe how, by
                  decoupling knowledge about machine learning
                  algorithms from the process of teaching, we can
                  accelerate innovation and empower millions of new
                  uses for machine learning models.},

  abstract =     {In this paper we try to organize machine teaching as
                  a coherent set of ideas. Each idea is presented as
                  varying along a dimension. The collection of
                  dimensions then form the problem space of machine
                  teaching, such that existing teaching problems can
                  be characterized in this space. We hope this
                  organization allows us to gain deeper understanding
                  of individual teaching problems, discover
                  connections among them, and identify gaps in the
                  field.},
