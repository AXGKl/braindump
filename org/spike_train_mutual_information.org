#+TITLE: Spike Train Mutual Information

Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal spike
trains in [[file:spiking_neural_networks.org][Spiking Neural Networks]]. Perhaps we can learn some low-level spike
representation, and relate this somehow to [[file:information_bottleneck_dnn.org][Information Bottleneck in Deep Neural
Networks]].
