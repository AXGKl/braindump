#+TITLE: Spike Train Mutual Information

Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal
spike trains in [[file:spiking_neural_networks.org][§spiking_neural_networks]]. Perhaps we can learn some
low-level spike representation, and relate this somehow to the
[[file:information_bottleneck_dnn.org][§information_bottleneck_dnn]] theory.
