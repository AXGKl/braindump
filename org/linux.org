- ~127.0.1.1~ in ~/etc/hosts~ is to allow some applications like Gnome to
  resolve the hostname to an ip address with a canonical fully
  qualified domain name - FQDN ([[http://www.leonardoborda.com/blog/127-0-1-1-ubuntu-debian/][Source]])
- ~sudo~ needs to resolve hostnames because the sudoers file specifies
  hostnames in the rules. Hence sudo requires both loopback and
  "real". ([[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/218145/why-does-sudo-need-the-loopback-interface][Source]])
