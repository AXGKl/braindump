* Motivations
- There's a ton of books covering the art of writing, and very little
  on note-taking.
- These books don't cover the connections between note-taking and
  writing well.

Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking
process. -- [[file:20200213173516.org][Richard Feynman]]

The mind is extremely reliant of external scaffolding:

Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not make contemporary
physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
possible -- Neil Levy (Neuroethics and the Extended Mind)
#+end_quote

Hence, use the [[file:zettelkasten.org][Zettelkasten]] method. To get around this idea of
note-taking, it is important to understand that:

1. Note sequences are meant for developing ideas, not storing them
2. Links and indices  are helpful, but not central features
3. The workflow is streamlined to writing

In [[file:zettelkasten.org][Zettelkasten]], the most time-consuming portion is determining /the
order/ for the notes in which to write about.
