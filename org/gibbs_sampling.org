#+TITLE: Gibbs Sampling

Gibbs sampling is a special case of the [[file:metropolis_hastings.org][Metropolis-Hastings method]],
where a sequence of proposal distributions $q$ is defined in terms of
the conditional distributions of the joint distribution
$p(\mathbf{x})$, and proposals are always accepted.

In the general case of a system with $K$ variables, a single iteration
involves sampling one parameter at a time:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}^{(t+1)} \sim P\left(x_{1} | x_{2}^{(t)}, x_{3}^{(t)}, \ldots, x_{K}^{(t)}\right)} \\ {x_{2}^{(t+1)} \sim P\left(x_{2} | x_{1}^{(t+1)}, x_{3}^{(t)}, \ldots, x_{K}^{(t)}\right)} \\ {x_{3}^{(t+1)} \sim P\left(x_{3} | x_{1}^{(t+1)}, x_{2}^{(t+1)}, \ldots, x_{K}^{(t)}\right), \text { etc. }}\end{array}
\end{equation}

* Pros and Cons
1. Suffers the same defects as [[file:metropolis_hastings.org][Metropolis-Hastings methods]]
2. No adjustable parameters, so it's easy to start with
