#+TITLE: Surrogate Gradient Learning In Spiking Neural Networks

- paper :: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09948v2.pdf

Spiking Neural Networks enable power-efficient network models, which
have become of increasing importance in embedded and auto-motive
applications. The power efficiency stems from dispensing of expensive
floating-point computations.
