#+TITLE: Global Localization

Localization is the problem of estimating the robots coordinates in an
external reference frame from sensor data, using a map of the
environment.

The robot's momentary estimate (belief) is represented by a
probability density function over the space of all locations. A
uniform distribution as prior represents maximal uncertainty.
