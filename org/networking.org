* Introduction
** What is the Internet?

The internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of
millions of computing devices throughout the world.

End systems are connected together by a network of /communication links/
and /packet switches/. The common packet switches are routers and
link-layer switches. The sequence of communication links and packet
switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the
receiving end system is known as the route, or path through a network.

End systems access the internet through /Internet Service Providers
(ISPs)/. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end
systems. 

End systems, packet switches and other pieces of the Internet run
protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within
the internet. The Internet's principal protocols are the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), known
collectively as TCP/IP.

** What is a protocol?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged
between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions
taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

** The Network Edge

The computers and other devices that are connected to the Internet are
often called end systems. This is because they sit at the edge of the
Internet. Each system are also referred to as hosts because they host
application programs such as the web browser, or a server. Hosts are
sometimes further divided into 2 categories: /clients/ and /servers/. 

Access networks include the digital subscriber line (DSL), cable, and
fiber to the home (FTTH). Ethernet and WiFi access networks are now
common across enterprise, university campuses as well as in homes.
Wide-area wireless access such as 4G and LTE provide wireless access
to the Internet by sending and receiving packets through a base
station.

** Physical Mediums
For reach transmitter-receiver pair, bits are interchanged. These bits
are sent by electromagnetic waves, or optical pulses across a physical
medium. 

The least expensive and most commonly used transmission medium is the
twisted-pair copper wire. It consists of 2 insulated copper wires,
twisted togethter to reduce electrical interference from similar pairs
close by.

Coaxial cables consist of 2 copper conductors, but the two conductors
are concentric rather than parallel. These achieve high data
transmission rates, and can be used as a guided shared medium. They
are common in cable television systems.

** The Network Core

*** Packet Switching

In a network application, end systems exchange messages with each
other. Messages can contain anything the application designer wants.
To send a message from a source end system to a destination end
system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data
known as /packets/. Each packet travels through communication links and
packet switches. Packets are transmitted over each communication link
at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link. So if a
source end system or a packet switch is sending a packet of $L$ bits
over a link with transmission rate $R$ bits/sec, then the time to
transmit the packet is $\frac{L}{R}$ seconds.


Most packet switches use /store-and-forward transmission/ at the inputs
to the links. This means that the packet switch must receive the
entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the
packet onto the outbound link. 

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each
attached link, the packet switch has an /output buffer/, which stores
packets that the router is about to send into that link. If an
arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link
busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must
wait in the output buffer. This results in output buffer /queuing
delays/. Packet loss will occur -- either the arriving packet or one of
the already-queued packets will be dropped.

How does a router determine which link it should forward the packet
onto? In the Internet, each end system is assigned an IP address. The
source end system includes the destination IP address in the packet's
header. Each router has a /forwarding table/ that maps destination
addresses to its outbound links. 

*** Circuit Switching

In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along apath
(buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between
end-systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session
between the end systems. Traditional telephone networks are examples
of such circuit-switched networks.

A circuit in a link is implemented with either /frequency-division
multiplexing (FDM)/ or /time-division multiplexing (TDM)/. With FDM, the
frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections
established across the link. For a TDM link, time is divided into
frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed
number of time slots.

Packet switching is offers better sharing of transmission capacity
than circuit switching, and is simpler and more efficient. However,
circuit switching can be more suitable for real-time services.

** A Network of Networks

A PoP is a group of one or more routers in the provider's network
where customer ISPs can connect into a provider ISP. For a customer
network to connect to a provider's PoP, it can lease a high-speed link
from a third-party telecommunications provider to directly connect one
of its routers to a router at the PoP. Any ISP may choose to
multi-home, that is, to connect to two or more provider ISPs.

** Delays in Packet-Switched Networks

1. Processing delay
   1. Time needed to check bit-level errors in packet
2. Queuing delay
   1. Time spent waiting to be transmitted in the link
3. Transmission delay
   1. Equal to $L/R$. Transmission delays are typically on the order
      of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.
4. Propagation delay
   1. The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link,
      depending on the physical medium. This speed is roughly the
      speed of light.

Packet loss can occur when it arrives to find a full queue. The router
will drop the packet.

Given these delays, we can compute the end-to-end delay.

\begin{equation}
  d_{\text{e2e}} = N(d_{\text{proc}} + d_{\text{trans}} + d_{\text{prop}})
\end{equation}

This does not account for the average queuing delay of the node.

** Throughput
The instantaneous throughput at any instant of time is the rate (in
bits/sec) at which a host is receiving the file. 

** Protocol Layers and Their Service Models

The Internet Protocol stack consists of 5 layers: the physical link,
network, transport, and application layers. The OSI reference model
consists of 7 layers.

- Application layer :: network applications and application layer
     protocols reside here. These protocol include HTTP, SMUT and FTP.
     The packet of information at this layer is a *message*.
- Transport Layer :: in the Internet there are 2 transport protocols:
     TCP and UDP, each with their own use-case. Each transport-layer
     packet is called a segment.
- Network Layer :: responsible for moving packets known as *datagrams*
                   from one host to another. It has many routing protocols.
- Link Layer :: The network layer relies on this layer to deliver the
                datagram to the next node along the route. These
                services depend on the specific link-layer protocol
                employed for the link. For example, cable access
                networks may use the DOCSIS protocol. Link layer
                protocols include Ethernet and WiFi. Link-layer
                packets are referred to as *frames*.
- Physical Layer :: responsible of moving individual bits across
                    physical mediums.
