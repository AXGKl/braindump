* The Church of Emacs

** What is Emacs?
- the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display
  editor
- An environment with a Turing-complete programming language (Emacs
  Lisp) *designed around the manipulation of text*
- Goes against the unix philosophy: one tool for everything
- The true hacker's editor

** Emacs Highlights
- Edit files over many remote protocols (ssh, ftp etc.) as if local
- Extremely powerful text-based clients
  - Mail ([[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]], [[https://notmuchmail.org/notmuch-emacs/][notmuch]])
  - RSS ([[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]])
  - File Management ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]])
  - Git ([[https://magit.vc/][Magit]])
  - Kubernetes ([[https://github.com/chrisbarrett/kubernetes-el][kubernetes-el]])
- Org-mode (Thesis writing, planning, cheatsheet)

** Who Uses Emacs? cite:famous_emacs_users
- Julian Assange (Wikileaks)
- Yukihiro Matsumoto (Ruby)
- Guido van Rossum (Python)
- Rich Hickey (Clojure)
- Joe Armstrong (Erlang)
- Neal Stephenson (Writer)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the GNU/Linux world there are two major text editing programs: the
minimalist vi (known in some implementations as elvis) and the
maximalist emacs. I use emacs, which might be thought of as a
thermonuclear word processor... emacs outshines all other editing
software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the
stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything
else vanish. --- Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line (1981)

** Emacs at Amazon cite:yegge_tour_de_babel

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mailman was the Customer Service customer-email processing application
for ... four, five years? A long time, anyway. It was written in
Emacs. Everyone loved it.

* Basic Emacs
** Keyboard Notations
- ~C-x~ :: Ctrl-x
- ~M-x~ :: Alt-x
** Basic Commands
- ~C-x C-c~ :: Quit Emacs
- ~C-g~ :: Cancel current command (spammable)

** Emacs Tutorial
- ~M-x~ brings up the interactive command launch environment
- We want to launch ~M-x help-with-tutorial~
- We can tab-complete here ~M-x help-<TAB>~

* Configuring Emacs
** Configuring Emacs
Configuring Emacs is the same as writing Emacs Lisp code to be
evaluated during program launch time. Emacs looks for your init file
in the following locations (in order):
  - =~/.emacs=
  - =~/.emacs.el=
  - =~/.emacs.d/init.el= (preferred)

** Installing packages

*** Adding package mirrors

Emacs needs to know where to fetch packages from. Here we add 2
mirrors, the Org mirror and the [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA mirror]], where most community
packages are hosted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
  (package-initialize)
#+end_src

*** Listing Installable Packages                                :B_columns:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: columns
:END:

**** Left                                                          :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.4
:END:
We run ~M-x package-refresh-contents~ to pull new content from the
mirrors. 

We can see a list of packages to install by running ~M-x
list-packages~:

*** Exercise: Installing Counsel/Ivy

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] is a better interface for basic Emacs tasks.

* Tips
** Getting Productive Quickly

Vanilla Emacs is powerful, but often not powerful enough for
day-to-day work. An easy way to get started is to use a starter kit:

- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]]
- [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]]
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Centaur Emacs]]

** Evil-mode

If you like Vim's modal editing, consider [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil-mode]]. Evil + Emacs
allows you to fully emulate Vim's modal editing capabilities,
alongside the power of scripting in Emacs Lisp.

** Remap Capslock to Ctrl                                         :B_column:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: column
:END:

*** Left                                                            :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.6
:END:
This will save you from Emacs pinky. Treat yourself to a good
keyboard, you're going to be using one heavily in the foreseeable
future.

*** Right                                                           :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.4

** Study Emacs Configurations
Emacs is a tinkerer's editor: make it your own. Scratch your itch,
experiment with packages. [[*Config Files][Look at what other people use]] and see if you
like them.

** Emacsclient

Emacs start-up time is non-negligible (mine is around 3s), especially
when you have a lot of packages and Elisp to evaluate. Solution: [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon][run
emacs as a daemon]], and launch clients that connect to it.
