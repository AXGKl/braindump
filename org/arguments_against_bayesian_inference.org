#+TITLE: Arguments Against Bayesian Inference

Whereas frequentist methods derive solutions via inventing estimators
(a multitude of them may exist) and computing a likelihood function,
Bayesian methods only offer one answer to a well-posed problem.

The Bayesian inference method is conditioned on assumptions (for
example, the prior). Some say the prior introduces subjectivity. *But
how can one make inferences without assumptions?* Bayesian methods
force us to make these assumptions /explicit/.

Once the assumptions are made, the inferences are objective, unique,
and can be agreed upon by everyone. These assumptions are easy to
modify, and we can quantify the sensitivity of our inferences to our
assumptions. It also quantifies the uncertainty in our inferences.
