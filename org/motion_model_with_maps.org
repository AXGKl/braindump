#+TITLE: Motion Model With Maps

Often, we are given map $m$ of the environment, giving us further
information about the robot pose $x_t$. In general,

\begin{equation}
  p\left(x_{t} | u_{t}, x_{t-1}\right) \neq p\left(x_{t} | u_{t}, x_{t-1}, m\right)
\end{equation}

And the map-based motion model should give better results. Computing
this motion model in closed form is difficult. An approximation via
factorization works well where the distance $x_{t-1}$ and $x_t$ is
small.

\begin{equation}
  p\left(x_{t} | u_{t}, x_{t-1}, m\right)=\eta p\left(x_{t} | u_{t}, x_{t-1}\right) p\left(x_{t} | m\right)
\end{equation}
